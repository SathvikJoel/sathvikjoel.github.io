Eager to share my experience and valuable resources that fueled my preparation. A focal point of this endeavor is to furnish ChatGPT prompts tailored for the speaking section, a facet I personally found challenging. Moreover, I’ll elucidate the strategies and insights that proved instrumental in my success, encompassing adept utilization of ChatGPT. Stay tuned for an insightful exploration of my TOEFL preparation saga, laden with practical tips and tricks.\nTOEFL iBT Overview 📝 Here is a short introduction to the TOEFL iBT exam:\nThere are four sections: Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing. The exam is scored out of 120 points, with each section worth 30 points. The IBT section is to be taken at the exam center Total time: 2.5 hours ( approx ) Let me eloboarate on the each sections format and structure:\nReading 2 passages, each 700 words multiple-focus passages (compare/contrast, cause/effect) 10 questions for each passage Estimated Timing: 35 minutes\nListening 3 lectures, some with classroom discussion, each 3–5 minutes, 6 questions each 2 conversations, each 3 minutes, 5 questions each Estimated Timing: 36 minutes\nSpeaking 4 tasks 1 independent task to express an opinion on a familiar topic 3 integrated tasks based on what is read and heard Up to 30 seconds to prepare the response, up to 1 minute to respond Estimated Timing: 16 minutes\nWriting 2 tasks: 1 20-minute integrated task based on what is read and heard 1 10-minute Writing for an Academic Discussion task to state and support an opinion in an online classroom discussion Estimated Timing: 29 minutes\nTake time to understand the pattern of the exam this will help you get to speed with the exam faster.\nRecommendation 💡 If you’re just starting your TOEFL preparation, I suggest trying out the practice test on the official TOEFL website TOEFL TEST. Even if you haven’t studied yet, doing this can give you a sense of how the exam is structured and where you stand. It’s a helpful first step, and I highly recommend it. Templates ✅ In this section I will introduce the idea of templates and give an example of how to use it, in later section I will also provide differnt templates for each section of the exam.\nWhat is a TEMPLATE ? 🤔 In the TOEFL iBT exam, each question follows a specific style that remains consistent. Think of a template as a guide for your answer, showing you how to start, connect ideas, and more. Memorizing a template saves time during the brief preparation (less than 30 seconds per question in the speaking test), allowing you to focus on the main content of your answer. Templates are incredibly helpful for an efficient response.\nAn Example of a Template 😁 Consider the first question in the speaking section, this is a personal choice questoin, that is it gives you 2 options and you have to choose one and explain why you chose it.\nA question be like :\nSome people prefer to read physical books made from paper, while others prefer to read electronic books on a digital device. Which do you prefer and why?\nAn example template is as follows:\nTemplate 💡 I believe that (my choice)\nI feel this way for the following reason.\nFirst of all, (reason 1)\nFor instance, (example 1)\nAlso, (reason 2)\nFor example (example 2)\nFor those reasons I think.\nUsing this template you can make your own responce, a sample answer is provided below\nSample Answer 💡 I believe that I prefer physical books made from paper.\nI feel this way for the following reason. First of all, there is a certain tactile and sensory experience associated with flipping through the pages of a physical book that I find immensely satisfying. The smell of paper, the rustle of pages turning, and the weight of the book in my hands contribute to a unique reading atmosphere.\nFor instance, when reading a paperback on a lazy Sunday afternoon, the act of physically marking progress by turning pages creates a tangible connection to the story. It enhances the overall enjoyment and immersion in the narrative.\nAlso, I appreciate the lack of screen time that comes with reading a paper book. In a world dominated by digital devices, the simplicity of a physical book provides a welcome break from the constant exposure to screens.\nFor example, during travel, I find it more enjoyable to pull out a book from my bag rather than staring at another electronic screen. The absence of notifications and the potential for distractions contribute to a more focused and serene reading experience.\nFor these reasons, I think that physical books offer a unique and irreplaceable charm, making them my preferred choice for reading\nImportant Resources 📚 Here’s a roundup of must-have tools to ensure you’re ready to tackle the test with confidence.\nTOEFL Resources by Michael Goodine\nMichael Goodine’s website is a treasure trove of sample questions, templates, and valuable tips.

Happy studying!\nA Closer Look at Each TOEFL Section: Tips, Tricks, and Templates Here’s a concise breakdown of each section along with practical tips, tricks, and handy templates to elevate your performance.\nReading 📖 Structure 💡 Time: 35 mins\n2 passage, 10 questions each, 700 words in each passage\nType of reading passage you would typically encounter in first year of university\nTips 💡 Time is of the essence in the TOEFL reading section. Allocate a maximum of 16 minutes to each passage during practice. Since there are two sections, this ensures you have ample time for both without sacrificing one for the other. Set a timer during your practice to simulate exam conditions effectively.\nThe TOEFL reading questions follow a structured sequence, typically aligning with the passage’s order. Focus on the questions related to the first paragraph before moving on to the subsequent ones. This sequential approach can streamline your thought process and enhance efficiency.\nConsider adopting a selective reading strategy during your practice sessions. Instead of reading the entire passage before attempting questions, start by reading the first passage. Answer the initial set of questions related to that passage before moving on to the second passage. This approach not only saves time but also allows for a more targeted understanding of the material.\nListenting 👂 Structure 💡 3 passages, 5-6 questions per passage\nPassage 1 → Conversation, 5 questions\nPassage 2 → Lecture, 6 questions\nPassage 3 → Lecture, 6 questions\nTips 💡 Taking notes during the Listening section is a game-changer. Since some questions delve into specific details, jotting down key points can be a lifesaver during the answering phase. Effective note-taking enhances your ability to recall crucial information.\nIn the Listening section, there’s no turning back. Unlike the Reading section, you can’t revisit previous questions. Approach each question with caution and answer confidently, keeping in mind that once you’ve moved on, there’s no going back.\nBe alert for questions that inquire about the purpose of the conversation. Sometimes, the initial topic might mislead you. However, in the middle of the dialogue, one of the speakers may unveil the actual reason behind their discussion. Pay close attention to these shifts to ensure accuracy in your responses.\nSpeaking 🗣️ I personally found this section to be the hardest, I practised it the most and I scored 29/30. This section is hard because you need to come up with your own words in very less time and you are expected to present your ideas in cohorent and with a clear flow. Practising this section will also improve your speaking skills in general.\nStructure 💡 There are 4 questions. 1 independent, 3 integrated.\nQ1 → 15 seconds to prepare, 45 seconds to speak.\nQ2 → 30 seconds to prepare, 60 seconds to speak.\nQ3 → 30 seconds to prepare, 60 seconds to speak.\nQ4 → 20 seconds to prepare, 60 seconds to speak.\nIndependent Question\nGeneral Opinion of a wide range of topics, you usually have 2 options.\nPersonal Preference, Agree or Disagree\nSound natural and conversational\nForm one sided opinion as quickly as possible.\nIntegrated Question (Campus Announcement and Conversation)\n50 seconds to read.\n60-120 seconds to listen.\n30 seconds to prepare.\n60 seconds to prepare.\nThink like a reporter.\nQuestion Form:\nAnnouncement: Change + 2 reasons\nConversation: Opinion + 2 reasons\nQ3 (Academic Reading and Lecture)\nThere is a passage, and a lecture.\nThe Lecture introduces 2 examples on the topic introduced in the reading.\nThink like a teacher.\nArticle: Concept Lecture: Concept + Details Task: Question about the task Combine the information from 1, 2 establish a link between the both\nQ4 (Academic Lecture)\n120-180 seconds to listen.\n20 seconds to prepare.\n60 seconds to prepare.\nLecture: Topic + definition + examples (s)\nTips 💡 Practice, Practice, Practice! The speaking section may seem daunting, but the key to mastering it is simple: practice. Record yourself responding to different prompts, listen to your answers, and pinpoint areas where you can improve. The more you practice, the more comfortable and confident you’ll become. Remember, perfection comes with consistent practice.\nTemplates are your best friend. Templates are your secret weapon in the speaking section. They provide a structured framework for your responses, helping you organize your thoughts effectively. Invest time in memorizing a few templates and practice incorporating them into your answers. This not only saves time during the exam but also ensures a smooth and coherent delivery.\nTake Notes For questions 2, 3, and 4, note-taking is your ally. Tailor your notes to each question’s specific model. For instance, in Question 2, the reading typically presents two reasons, and the listening speaker either agrees or disagrees with these reasons. Adapt your note-taking accordingly, and use templates that align with the question’s structure. This strategic approach simplifies the process and boosts your confidence.\nSpeaking Template for Task 1💡 I\nI believe that (my choice)\nI feel this way for the following reason.\nFirst of all, (reason 1)\nFor instance, (example 1)\nAlso, (reason 2)\nFor example (example 2)\nFor those reasons I think.\nTransitional Words + ideas expanded.\nII\nIn my opinion, …\nI feel this way for two reasons.\nFirst, I think that…\nFor example, …\nSecond, I believe that…\nFor instance, …\nFor those reasons I think\nSpeaking Template for Task 2💡 Talk about the change\nThe announcement states that…\nGive 2 reasons (in past tense)\nThe notice gives two reasons for this.\nFirst, …\nSecond,…\nTransition\nThe women/ man had a negative/positive attitude about the notice…\nHe/she supports/opposes it for two reasons.\nGive 2 reasons\nFirst, she stated that,…\nSecond, she pointed out that…\nPRO TIP: Use terms like he emphasizes, he mentions that,… dont always say “he says”\nSpeaking Template for Task 3💡 Paraphrase the definition\nThe article discusses… and defines it as …\nDetail\nThe writer states that …\nSpeakers topic\nThe lecturer discuses the role of .. in .. and provided an example /two examples.\nFor example,…\nFor instance,…\nHe/she provdes an example of …\nConclusion\nConsequently, based on the information in both passages.\nPRO TIP: Need to have the template ready, because it may be theoretical information, in the passages\nSpeaking Template for Task 4💡 The lecture is about… which is defined as… ( use ur own words )\nFirst, the lecturer states that,…\nFor instance,…\nSecond, the speaker mentions that,…\nFor example,…\nPRO TIP: Understanding what the lecture is about, make sure to write down key words, definitions, examples are key.\nChatGPT Prompt 💡 “State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement. Then explain your reasons using specific details in your argument. Teachers should assign daily homework to students.”\n“Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should help their parents with household chores as soon as they are old enough. Use details and examples in your response.”\n“There are many different approaches to academic studies, and all of them have specific benefits. Do you prefer to study for tests in a group, or to study alone? Include details and examples to support your explanation.”\n“Some people like to watch television news programs every day, while others like to watch them only now and then. Which do you prefer? Include details and examples to support your explanation.”\n“Do you agree or disagree with the statement: ‘Artificial intelligence will eventually replace most human jobs.’ Support your answer with details and examples.”\n“Should governments invest more in space exploration and research? Explain whether you agree or disagree, and provide specific reasons and examples to support your stance.”\n“Some people prefer to read physical books made from paper, while others prefer to read electronic books on a digital device. Which do you prefer and why?”\n“Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Teenagers should work while they go to school, so they can learn how to be more responsible. Provide details and examples to explain your opinion.”\n“Some companies have rules that forbid employees from using personal cell phones during working hours. Do you think this is a good idea? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.”\n“Nowadays, some people use extreme methods, including surgery, to change their appearance. They do this because they want to look more attractive. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your answer with details and examples.”\n“Some people enjoy taking risks and trying new things. Others are not adventurous; they are cautious and prefer to avoid danger. Which behavior do you think is better? Explain why?”\nYour task is to come up with more questions like these, they should ask for personal opinions .\nYou can use this ChatGPT prompt to practice your speaking skills this will give you lot more examples than provided and you can practise on them, this prompt is only for the first speaking question which I found is harder compared to other questions. But at the end I will provide more tricks on how to use ChatGPT to your advantage.\nWriting ✍️ Structure 💡 Integrated Task\nThere will be a passage, that has a main argument and three supporting points! ( 3 mins reading, text disappears)\nThen there is a listening, (3 mins), lecture always challenges the article.\nYou are required to answer a question that looks like Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they oppose specific points made in the reading passage. Ignore the suggested length in this section, they ask you to write 300 words.\nAcademic Discussion Task\nIt is like a chatroom conversation with one question posed by the teacher, then two responses from students.\nThere is a prompt that looks like this:\nexpress and support your opinion. make a contribution to the discussion. An effective answer will contain at least 100 words.\nYou must build on the ideas that have already been given You need to decide if you agree or disagree with the view of the other students. You need to politely state how you feel Template for Task 1 💡 The reading and the lecture are both centered on the topic of [insert topic].\nWhile the author of the article asserts that [insert author’s argument],\nthe lecturer raises objections to these claims and posits that [insert lecturer’s position].\n( OR\nBoth the reading and the lecture revolve around the subject of [insert subject].\nWhile the author in the reading contends that [insert author’s viewpoint],\nthe lecturer takes a different perspective, arguing that [insert lecturer’s perspective\n)\nAccording to the reading, [insert key point from reading]. The article mentions that [insert supporting evidence from reading]. This argument is challenged by the lecturer, who claims that [insert lecturer’s counter-argument]. Additionally, he points out that [insert lecturer’s supporting evidence].\nThe author in the reading suggests [insert reading’s argument]. In the article, it notes that [insert supporting evidence from reading]. The lecturer, however, asserts that [insert lecturer’s counter-argument]. He goes on to say that [insert lecturer’s supporting evidence].\nTemplate for Task 2 💡 Depending on whether you disagree with both or agree with one of them you can make new templates, but the basic structure is as follows:\nWrite an opening statement about the topic.\nDefinetly mention whether you agree with or disagree with other students. (\nI agree with the first student, because [insert reason 1] OR\nThought I agree with the first student, I disagree with the second student, because [insert reason 1] OR\nI understand the concerns of the second student, but I agree with the first student, because [insert reason 1] )\nThen mention your own argument. This is really important, the tasks asks you to add your own idea. This should be the majpr part of your answer.\nOther Tips and Tricks 🎁 ChatGPT When doing the writing section, whatever you write during the practice, copy it to ChatGPT and prompt it as follows\nRewrite it to match the standard of the TOEFL exam. Use advanced vocaboloury, sound cohrent and natural.\nYou can make modifications to the prompt to suit your needs, but this is the basic idea. This will help you improve your writing skills and also help you get a better score.\nSpeaking For Windows laptop users, try the Speech to Text application (launch with Windows Key + H). It helps convert your speech to text, allowing you to spot mistakes and enhance your speaking skills. Additionally, paste the text into ChatGPT for further improvement.\nAvoid pauses in the speaking test, as points may be deducted for that.\nPencils and Paper During the test, you’ll get a pencil, so practice with one to get used to it. Also, you’ll receive paper; use it for note-taking during your preparation.\nNoise It’s crucial to realize that there will be distractions during the TOEFL test. Other students might be taking the speaking test while you’re doing reading or listening. This is important – a friend got distracted and had to retake the test. When practicing, pick a place with people talking to get used to it.

Think of a template as a guide for your answer, showing you how to start, connect ideas, and more. Memorizing a template saves time during the brief preparation (less than 30 seconds per question in the speaking test), allowing you to focus on the main content of your answer. Templates are incredibly helpful for an efficient response.</p><h2 id=an-example-of-a-template->An Example of a Template 😁<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#an-example-of-a-template->#</a></h2><p>Consider the first question in the speaking section, this is a personal choice questoin, that is it gives you 2 options and you have to choose one and explain why you chose it.</p><p>A question be like :</p><blockquote><p>Some people prefer to read physical books made from paper, while others prefer to read electronic books on a digital device.

First of all,</em> there is a certain tactile and sensory experience associated with flipping through the pages of a physical book that I find immensely satisfying. The smell of paper, the rustle of pages turning, and the weight of the book in my hands contribute to a unique reading atmosphere.</p><p><em>For instance,</em> when reading a paperback on a lazy Sunday afternoon, the act of physically marking progress by turning pages creates a tangible connection to the story. It enhances the overall enjoyment and immersion in the narrative.</p><p><em>Also,</em> I appreciate the lack of screen time that comes with reading a paper book. In a world dominated by digital devices, the simplicity of a physical book provides a welcome break from the constant exposure to screens.</p><p><em>For example,</em> during travel, I find it more enjoyable to pull out a book from my bag rather than staring at another electronic screen. The absence of notifications and the potential for distractions contribute to a more focused and serene reading experience.</p><p><em>For these reasons,</em> I think that physical books offer a unique and irreplaceable charm, making them my preferred choice for reading</p></div></details></div><h1 id=important-resources->Important Resources 📚<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#important-resources->#</a></h1><p>Here&rsquo;s a roundup of must-have tools to ensure you&rsquo;re ready to tackle the test with confidence.</p><ol><li><p><strong>TOEFL Resources by Michael Goodine</strong></p><ul><li>Michael Goodine&rsquo;s website is a treasure trove of sample questions, templates, and valuable tips.

Focus on the questions related to the first paragraph before moving on to the subsequent ones. This sequential approach can streamline your thought process and enhance efficiency.</p></li><li><p>Consider adopting a selective reading strategy during your practice sessions. Instead of reading the entire passage before attempting questions, start by reading the first passage. Answer the initial set of questions related to that passage before moving on to the second passage.

Unlike the Reading section, you can&rsquo;t revisit previous questions. Approach each question with caution and answer confidently, keeping in mind that once you&rsquo;ve moved on, there&rsquo;s no going back.</p></li><li><p>Be alert for questions that inquire about the purpose of the conversation.

Record yourself responding to different prompts, listen to your answers, and pinpoint areas where you can improve. The more you practice, the more comfortable and confident you&rsquo;ll become. Remember, perfection comes with consistent practice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Templates are your best friend.</strong> Templates are your secret weapon in the speaking section. They provide a structured framework for your responses, helping you organize your thoughts effectively. Invest time in memorizing a few templates and practice incorporating them into your answers. This not only saves time during the exam but also ensures a smooth and coherent delivery.</p></li><li><p><strong>Take Notes</strong> For questions 2, 3, and 4, note-taking is your ally. Tailor your notes to each question&rsquo;s specific model. For instance, in Question 2, the reading typically presents two reasons, and the listening speaker either agrees or disagrees with these reasons. Adapt your note-taking accordingly, and use templates that align with the question&rsquo;s structure. This strategic approach simplifies the process and boosts your confidence.</p></li></ol></div></details></div><div id=speaking-template class=toc style=margin-bottom:20px;background:var(--theme)><details><summary><div class=details>Speaking Template for Task 1💡</div></summary><div class=inner><p><strong>I</strong></p><p>I believe that (my choice)</p><p>I feel this way for the following reason.</p><p>First of all, (reason 1)</p><p>For instance, (example 1)</p><p>Also, (reason 2)</p><p>For example (example 2)</p><p>For those reasons I think.</p><p>Transitional Words + ideas expanded.</p><p><strong>II</strong></p><p>In my opinion, …</p><p>I feel this way for two reasons.</p><p>First, I think that…</p><p>For example, …</p><p>Second, I believe that…</p><p>For instance, …</p><p>For those reasons I think</p></div></details></div><div id=speaking-template class=toc style=margin-bottom:20px;background:var(--theme)><details><summary><div class=details>Speaking Template for Task 2💡</div></summary><div class=inner><ol><li><p>Talk about the change</p><p>The announcement states that…</p></li><li><p>Give 2 reasons (in past tense)</p><p>The notice gives two reasons for this.</p><p>First, …</p><p>Second,…</p></li><li><p>Transition</p><p>The women/ man had a negative/positive attitude about the notice…</p><p>He/she supports/opposes it for two reasons.</p></li><li><p>Give 2 reasons</p><p>First, she stated that,…</p><p>Second, she pointed out that…</p><p><strong>PRO TIP: Use terms like he emphasizes, he mentions that,… dont always say “he says”</strong></p></li></ol></div></details></div><div id=speaking-template class=toc style=margin-bottom:20px;background:var(--theme)><details><summary><div class=details>Speaking Template for Task 3💡</div></summary><div class=inner><ol><li><p>Paraphrase the definition</p><p>The article discusses… and defines it as …</p></li><li><p>Detail</p><p>The writer states that …</p></li><li><p>Speakers topic</p><p>The lecturer discuses the role of .. in .. and provided an example /two examples.</p><p>For example,…</p><p>For instance,…</p><p>He/she provdes an example of …</p></li><li><p>Conclusion</p><p>Consequently, based on the information in both passages.</p><p><strong>PRO TIP: Need to have the template ready, because it may be theoretical information, in the passages</strong></p></li></ol></div></details></div><div id=speaking-template class=toc style=margin-bottom:20px;background:var(--theme)><details><summary><div class=details>Speaking Template for Task 4💡</div></summary><div class=inner><p>The lecture is about… which is defined as… ( use ur own words )</p><p>First, the lecturer states that,…</p><p>For instance,…</p><p>Second, the speaker mentions that,…</p><p>For example,…</p><p><strong>PRO TIP: Understanding what the lecture is about, make sure to write down key words, definitions, examples are key.</strong></p></div></details></div><div id=Chatgpt-prompt class=toc style=margin-bottom:20px;background:var(--theme)><details><summary><div class=details>ChatGPT Prompt 💡</div></summary><div class=inner><p>“State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement.

Use advanced vocaboloury, sound cohrent and natural.</p></blockquote><p>You can make modifications to the prompt to suit your needs, but this is the basic idea. This will help you improve your writing skills and also help you get a better score.</p><h2 id=speaking>Speaking<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#speaking>#</a></h2><p>For Windows laptop users, try the Speech to Text application (launch with Windows Key + H). It helps convert your speech to text, allowing you to spot mistakes and enhance your speaking skills. Additionally, paste the text into ChatGPT for further improvement.</p><p>Avoid pauses in the speaking test, as points may be deducted for that.</p><h2 id=pencils-and-paper>Pencils and Paper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pencils-and-paper>#</a></h2><p>During the test, you&rsquo;ll get a pencil, so practice with one to get used to it. Also, you&rsquo;ll receive paper; use it for note-taking during your preparation.</p><h2 id=noise>Noise<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#noise>#</a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s crucial to realize that there will be distractions during the TOEFL test.

Don&rsquo;t overlook this factor.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>When reflecting on my exam preparation, I extend my sincere gratitude to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetan-reddy-n-566b641aa/?originalSubdomain=in">Chetan Reddy</a> for generously sharing invaluable tips that proved instrumental to my success.
