This guide breaks down how to make the best out of Kora, if you are planning to go clubbing there.\nNight in kora; you drink and then you dance and later you forget everything\nVibe of Kora clubs 🎶 Most of the Kora clubs are CLUBS, different from restro bars that you usually find in Indiranagar. Most of the clubs have a dance floor here (for all you dancers 💃). I am not sure which clubs play what kind of music, but all of them sound the same when you are drunk and dancing. But don’t expect any quietness in the clubs, it’s going to be pretty loud 🔊 and this is definitely not the place to take your date if you are looking for a conversation. They do have seating areas but you get it, you probably won’t be sitting.\nTimings and Days ⏰ Of course the more fancier nights are the weekend nights, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. I have never been to Kora on a weekday night, you shouldn’t too. The clubs start to buzz from evening but the best part starts from 9 or 9:30 PM, that’s the best time to enter the club. The clubs end around 1 AM. Exit the clubs early if you want to catch a cab and avoid the rush.\nEntry charges 💰 The cover charges usually range from 1500-1000 /- per head for stags (This is completely redeemable inside the club). For couples some clubs are free and obviously for single girls it’s free. But I think the cover charge is reasonable because you will anyway spend a minimum of that on alcohol.\nTips:\nSince it’s a free market (because of insane competition between different clubs) you can bargain the entry cover charge if they say 1500/- per person and you are three guys you could ask them for 1000/- per person. 💡 The optimisation problem here is to find the club that probably will have the best vibe for the night. On one of my clubbing nights I called it a POMDP (Partially Observable MDP Problem) 🤓 Dance Floor 💃🕺 As I have said earlier most of them have dance floors, but not all of them allow everyone to dance on the dance floor, haha, yes. Some clubs (Tipsy Bull for example) only allow couples to dance on the floor, so please ask that at the counter before you make the payment.\nTip: If you are a couple you probably would want to go to a club that only allows couples on dance floor this makes it easy for you to enjou your night.\nOverpriced Alcohol 🍺 The alcohol inside the club is overpriced (duh!). One way to optimise on this is to pre-booze. You could go to your nearest MRP and pre booze before you start from your place. This saves some money and gives you almost the same experience.\nTip: Pre booze if you can to save money on the -OH grp (some organic chemistry because your dating life sucks) 🧪😅\nFood in Kora 🍔 I almost always hated the food in clubs. The food tastes awful (as if you will just take any shit they give when you are drunk).\nTip: Truffles in Kora is one of the best food places I know in Bangalore. My usual ritual is to first have food there before I start clubbing in Kora. It is said that it’s a ritual to have food in Kora if you are in Bangalore, might as well finish that ritual when you are in Kora. ✨\nReaching There and Pricing 🚗💸 Kora is not strictly accessible by metro, this is one of my complaints, because come on. Most of my Kora nights have averaged around 3K, including the food at Truffles, my travel and ofc alcohol. I feel that’s a reasonable price for a night to kill my neurons in my hippocampus.\nOther things in Kora 🎭 Kora is more than clubs ofc. The other activity I have done in Kora is to attend stand up shows. There are some good ones like “The Underground Comedy Club” and “Ministry of Comedy”. They usually have some good line-ups over weekends, check BookMyShow. 😂\nMore tips 💡 Usually if it’s a good weekend, chances are you would choose a club based on your gut and it’s pretty nice. But in case you do go to a club and you feel that the vibe is not good enough, you just dance there for a while and then quit quietly from there. Most important thing here is to not spend your own money just exhaust the cover charge only. Then you can go to a different club and then again exhaust the cover charge there. The point being you will spend 2x normal cover charge per night anyway. Why not spend it in two clubs and get the vibe of two clubs?
