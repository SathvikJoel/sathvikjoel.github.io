{{< excursion anchor="recommendation" title="Recommendation üí°" >}}
If you're just starting your TOEFL preparation, I suggest trying out the practice test on the official TOEFL website [TOEFL TEST](https://www.ets.org/toefl/test-takers/ibt/prepare/practice-tests.html). Even if you haven't studied yet, doing this can give you a sense of how the exam is structured and where you stand. It's a helpful first step, and I highly recommend it.

# Templates ‚úÖ

In this section I will introduce the idea of templates and give an example of how to use it, in later section I will also provide differnt templates for each section of the exam.

## What is a TEMPLATE ? ü§î

In the TOEFL iBT exam, each question follows a specific style that remains consistent. Think of a template as a guide for your answer, showing you how to start, connect ideas, and more. Memorizing a template saves time during the brief preparation (less than 30 seconds per question in the speaking test), allowing you to focus on the main content of your answer. Templates are incredibly helpful for an efficient response.

## An Example of a Template üòÅ

Consider the first question in the speaking section, this is a personal choice questoin, that is it gives you 2 options and you have to choose one and explain why you chose it. 

A question be like :

> Some people prefer to read physical books made from paper, while others prefer to read electronic books on a digital device. Which do you prefer and why?


An example template is as follows:

{{< excursion anchor="template-example" title="Template üí°" >}}



I believe that (my choice)

I feel this way for the following reason.

First of all, (reason 1)

For instance, (example 1)

Also, (reason 2)

For example (example 2)

For those reasons I think.

{{< /excursion >}}

Using this template you can make your own responce, a sample answer is provided below

{{< excursion anchor="sample-answer" title="Sample Answer üí°" >}}

*I believe that* I prefer physical books made from paper.

*I feel this way for the following reason. First of all,* there is a certain tactile and sensory experience associated with flipping through the pages of a physical book that I find immensely satisfying. The smell of paper, the rustle of pages turning, and the weight of the book in my hands contribute to a unique reading atmosphere.

*For instance,* when reading a paperback on a lazy Sunday afternoon, the act of physically marking progress by turning pages creates a tangible connection to the story. It enhances the overall enjoyment and immersion in the narrative.

*Also,* I appreciate the lack of screen time that comes with reading a paper book. In a world dominated by digital devices, the simplicity of a physical book provides a welcome break from the constant exposure to screens.

*For example,* during travel, I find it more enjoyable to pull out a book from my bag rather than staring at another electronic screen. The absence of notifications and the potential for distractions contribute to a more focused and serene reading experience.

*For these reasons,* I think that physical books offer a unique and irreplaceable charm, making them my preferred choice for reading

# A Closer Look at Each TOEFL Section: Tips, Tricks, and Templates

Here's a concise breakdown of each section along with practical tips, tricks, and handy templates to elevate your performance.

## Reading üìñ


{{< excursion anchor="structure-reading" title="Structure üí°" >}}
Time: 35 mins 

2 passage, 10 questions each, 700 words in each passage

Type of reading passage you would typically encounter in first year of university
{{< /excursion >}}

{{< excursion anchor="tips-reading" title="Tips üí°" >}}

*  Time is of the essence in the TOEFL reading section. Allocate a maximum of 16 minutes to each passage during practice. Since there are two sections, this ensures you have ample time for both without sacrificing one for the other. Set a timer during your practice to simulate exam conditions effectively.

* The TOEFL reading questions follow a structured sequence, typically aligning with the passage's order. Focus on the questions related to the first paragraph before moving on to the subsequent ones. This sequential approach can streamline your thought process and enhance efficiency.

* Consider adopting a selective reading strategy during your practice sessions. Instead of reading the entire passage before attempting questions, start by reading the first passage. Answer the initial set of questions related to that passage before moving on to the second passage. This approach not only saves time but also allows for a more targeted understanding of the material.
{{< /excursion >}}


## Listenting üëÇ

{{< excursion anchor="structure-listening" title="Structure üí°" >}}

3 passages, 5-6 questions per passage

Passage 1 ‚Üí Conversation, 5 questions

Passage 2 ‚Üí Lecture, 6 questions

Passage 3 ‚Üí Lecture, 6 questions

{{< /excursion >}}

{{< excursion anchor="tips-listening" title="Tips üí°" >}}

1. Taking notes during the Listening section is a game-changer. Since some questions delve into specific details, jotting down key points can be a lifesaver during the answering phase. Effective note-taking enhances your ability to recall crucial information.

2. In the Listening section, there's no turning back. Unlike the Reading section, you can't revisit previous questions. Approach each question with caution and answer confidently, keeping in mind that once you've moved on, there's no going back.


3. Be alert for questions that inquire about the purpose of the conversation. Sometimes, the initial topic might mislead you. However, in the middle of the dialogue, one of the speakers may unveil the actual reason behind their discussion. Pay close attention to these shifts to ensure accuracy in your responses.

## Speaking üó£Ô∏è

I personally found this section to be the hardest, I practised it the most and I scored 29/30. This section is hard because you need to come up with your own words in very less time and you are expected to present your ideas in cohorent and with a clear flow. Practising this section will also improve your speaking skills in general.

{{< excursion anchor="structure-speaking" title="Structure üí°" >}}

There are 4 questions. 1 independent, 3 integrated.

Q1 ‚Üí 15 seconds to prepare, 45 seconds to speak.

Q2 ‚Üí 30 seconds to prepare, 60 seconds to speak.

Q3 ‚Üí 30 seconds to prepare, 60 seconds to speak.

Q4 ‚Üí 20 seconds to prepare, 60 seconds to speak.

**Independent Question**

General Opinion of a wide range of topics, you usually have 2 options. 

Personal Preference, Agree or Disagree

Sound natural and conversational

Form one sided opinion as quickly as possible.

**Integrated Question (Campus Announcement and Conversation)**

50 seconds to read.

60-120 seconds to listen.

30 seconds to prepare.

60 seconds to prepare.

Think like a reporter.

Question Form:

Announcement: Change + 2 reasons

Conversation: Opinion + 2 reasons

**Q3 (Academic Reading and Lecture)**

There is a passage, and a lecture.

The Lecture introduces 2 examples on the topic introduced in the reading.

Think like a teacher.

1. Article: Concept
2. Lecture: Concept + Details 

Task: Question about the task
Combine the information from 1, 2 establish a link between the both

**Q4 (Academic Lecture)**

120-180 seconds to listen.

20 seconds to prepare.

60 seconds to prepare.

Lecture: Topic + definition + examples (s)

{{< /excursion >}}

{{< excursion anchor="tips-speaking" title="Tips üí°" >}}

1. **Practice, Practice, Practice!** The speaking section may seem daunting, but the key to mastering it is simple: practice. Record yourself responding to different prompts, listen to your answers, and pinpoint areas where you can improve. The more you practice, the more comfortable and confident you'll become. Remember, perfection comes with consistent practice.

2. **Templates are your best friend.** Templates are your secret weapon in the speaking section. They provide a structured framework for your responses, helping you organize your thoughts effectively. Invest time in memorizing a few templates and practice incorporating them into your answers. This not only saves time during the exam but also ensures a smooth and coherent delivery.
   
3. **Take Notes** For questions 2, 3, and 4, note-taking is your ally. Tailor your notes to each question's specific model. For instance, in Question 2, the reading typically presents two reasons, and the listening speaker either agrees or disagrees with these reasons. Adapt your note-taking accordingly, and use templates that align with the question's structure. This strategic approach simplifies the process and boosts your confidence.

# Other Tips and Tricks üéÅ

## ChatGPT

When doing the writing section, whatever you write during the practice, copy it to ChatGPT and prompt it as follows

> Rewrite it to match the standard of the TOEFL exam. Use advanced vocaboloury, sound cohrent and natural.

You can make modifications to the prompt to suit your needs, but this is the basic idea. This will help you improve your writing skills and also help you get a better score.

## Speaking
For Windows laptop users, try the Speech to Text application (launch with Windows Key + H). It helps convert your speech to text, allowing you to spot mistakes and enhance your speaking skills. Additionally, paste the text into ChatGPT for further improvement.

Avoid pauses in the speaking test, as points may be deducted for that.

## Pencils and Paper
During the test, you'll get a pencil, so practice with one to get used to it. Also, you'll receive paper; use it for note-taking during your preparation.

## Noise
It's crucial to realize that there will be distractions during the TOEFL test. Other students might be taking the speaking test while you're doing reading or listening. This is important ‚Äì a friend got distracted and had to retake the test. When practicing, pick a place with people talking to get used to it. Don't overlook this factor.
