I extend a warm welcome to the second segment of my two-part series recounting the transformative journey of my MITACS internship at UBC, Canada. For those who may have missed the initial part, I invite you to peruse it as this post seamlessly continues the narrative. In this installment, I delve further into the intricacies of my personal expedition, encapsulating a comprehensive account of my encounters. From offering insights into the contours of my project, to painting a vivid picture of the city that played host to my internship, and to sharing the challenges I encountered and surmounted, this narrative unveils the multi-dimensional facets of my journey. Please join me as we embark on the next chapter, interwoven with academic insights and the unique charm of personal experience.

## Kelowna

My internship unfolded in the serene enclave of Kelowna, nestled within the province of British Columbia. This city exudes a tranquil ambiance that remarkably parallels the quietude of my hometown, Kakinada, in India, where my formative years were spent. The resonance between the two places is unmistakable, casting a sense of familiarity that I cherished during my time in Kelowna.

The attached images of the downtown area vividly capture the city's innate beauty. A focal point of my weekends became a visit to the downtown district, accompanied by the enjoyment of a soothing soju by the lakeside. The experience of basking by the waterfront, often extending into the sunset, engendered a profound sense of contentment.

Kelowna's climatic disposition adds to its allure, boasting pleasant summers and tolerable winters. This climatic advantage contributes to the city's appeal, drawing residents and visitors alike. Notably, Kelowna holds acclaim for its wineries, an aspect that garners enthusiasm from many. Although my personal inclinations didn't align with wine appreciation, I acknowledge the allure of exploring this facet for those who share a penchant for it. In this dynamic milieu, Kelowna emerges as a harmonious blend of nature's beauty, climatic comfort, and cultural nuances that collectively enrich the internship experience.

## Learning Opportunities 
My internship was a dynamic platform that offered a multifaceted spectrum of learning opportunities encompassing both technical and personal dimensions. To begin with the technical facet, the immersion into full-time research was a transformative experience. My project centered on neural code generation, a novel domain within my familiar realm of LLMs. The initial stage entailed an exhaustive literature review, which laid the groundwork for subsequent phases. A project proposal was crafted to address a specific research gap, and collaborative efforts transpired over the ensuing weeks. This endeavor was inherently challenging, requiring persistent technical acumen. Guided by the mentorship of Prof. Fard and with the invaluable support of my lab peers, I navigated the complexities and achieved commendable progress. The confluence of literature review and problem-solving engendered substantial learning within this domain.

On a personal note, the experience of engaging in full-time research resonated deeply. It illuminated the essence of a researcher's role and the requisite attributes for success. Personally, the immersion affirmed my affinity for research, solidifying my understanding of the dedication and practices essential for becoming a proficient researcher. Among the invaluable lessons, the practice of delving into research papers and adeptly summarizing their essence emerged as a cornerstone for effective research endeavors. This period of intensive exploration unfolded as a transformative chapter that broadened my horizons in more ways than one.

## ACL '23: A Journey of Insights and Exploration

[The Annual Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)](https://2023.aclweb.org/) is renowned as a pinnacle event in the field of Natural Language Processing. By a stroke of serendipity, this year's edition transpired in Toronto, Canada, seamlessly aligning with my stay in Kelowna. The confluence of events beckoned me to partake in the conference, fueled not only by its significance as my inaugural conference experience but also the allure of visiting Toronto, a vibrant metropolis.

### Toronto: An Enchanted Encounter

My initial encounter with Toronto left an indelible impression. The city's atmosphere carries an ethereal quality, and even amidst my global travels, this uniqueness stood out. Toronto's distinctive aura manifests as a heightened clarity, where the surrounding environment possesses an exceptional sharpness, an experience unlike any other. The venue for the conference, Westin, situated by the downtown shoreline, further heightened the experience. Below, I've shared a selection of images that capture the essence of the city.

### Conference Chronicles

Attending my inaugural conference was exhilarating. Notable highlights include:

1. **Structural Insights**: Immersed in the conference's structure, I witnessed the dynamic interplay of poster presentations and paper sessions, granting me insight into the intricacies of such scholarly gatherings.
2. **Encounter with Geoffrey Hinton**: A defining moment unfolded when I encountered Geoffrey Hinton, a trailblazer in Deep Learning. His speech resonated deeply and enriched my perspective.
3. **Networking Galore**: The conference proved an avenue for extensive networking. Engaging with PhD students and esteemed professors broadened my academic network and fostered meaningful connections.
4. **Cultural Exploration**: Beyond the academic realm, I savored diverse cuisines, explored attractions like [Ripley's Aquarium of Canada](https://www.ripleyaquariums.com/canada/), and partook in social activities, abstaining from dancing with a hint of jest.

Reflecting on the conference, its manifold facets collectively enriched my understanding and invigorated my spirit. The post-conference return to my lab was characterized by renewed vigor, fueled by a profusion of new ideas and insights.
